# Adaptive Layout Transformer GUI

## Overview
The Adaptive Layout Transformer GUI application demonstrates dynamic layout management in Java Swing using `GridLayout` and radio buttons. It allows users to switch between different column layouts dynamically.

## Features
- **Dynamic Layout Switching:** Users can select between 1, 2, or 3 column layouts using radio buttons.
- **GUI Components:** Includes a main window (`JFrame`), an inner panel (`JPanel`) with dynamic labels, and radio buttons (`JRadioButton`) for layout selection.
- **Event Handling:** Utilizes `ItemListener` to react to radio button selections and update the layout accordingly.

## How to Use
1. **Launch the Application:**
    - Execute `AdaptiveLayoutTransformerMain.java` to start the GUI.

2. **Select Layout Options:**
    - Use the radio buttons labeled "1 Column", "2 Columns", or "3 Columns" to switch between different grid layouts.

3. **View Dynamic Updates:**
    - Watch as the inner panel updates its layout in real-time based on the selected radio button.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE that supports Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
